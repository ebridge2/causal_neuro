## Simulation experiments

- [method_preproc_cmp.Rmd](./method_preproc_cmp.Rmd): This notebook generates Appendix Figure 8, which generates simulated samples and illustrates the impact of different causal pre-processing strategies on the samples that would be analyzed.
- [meas_commoncause_sims.Rmd](./meas_commoncause_sims.Rmd): This notebook generates Appendix Figure 9, which compares the impact of different analytical strategies on estimating and removing batch effects from simulated data when the common causes are known and measured.
- [unmeas_commoncause_sims.Rmd](./unmeas_commoncause_sims.Rmd): This notebook generates Appendix Figure 10, which compares the impact of different analytical strategies on estimating and removing batch effects from simulated data when the common causes are unmeasured, based on the extent to which the unmeasured common causes correlate with the measured common causes.
- [collider_sims.Rmd](./collider_sims.Rmd): This notebook generates Appendix Figure 11, which illustrates the ineffectiveness of different strategies for estimating causal effects under collision regimes.
