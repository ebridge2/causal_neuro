This folder contains two files:

- [confounding.Rmd](./confounding.Rmd): Corresponding to Appendix A3.3 in our corresponding paper, on diagnosing confounding biases during the exploratory stages of analysis.
- [selection_bias.Rmd](./selection_bias.Rmd): Appendix B2.2 in our corresponding paper, on diagnosing selection biases during the exploratory stages of analysis.

We strongly encourage the repurposing of our code used for both Appendix sections for your research purposes.

Note that both sections include several simulated examples, and other examples from the [ABCD study](https://abcdstudy.org/) and its subsequent derivatives. While you can run most of the code blocks without access to the ABCD study, access to the ABCD study and subsequent data derivatives requires a permissioned data use agreement. For more details and information on how to obtain a DUA, see [NBDC](https://www.nbdc-datahub.org/).
